# SQL_data_analyst_case1

For every Data Analyst is really important to do queries in SQL language.

Especially practical aspects of SQL queries writing and adjusting (buy, sell).

So I just wanted to add here some SQL case to show my data structure and queries.

All queries are in MS SQL (I know that also to solve all questions Python Pandas is great).
